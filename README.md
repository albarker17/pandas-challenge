When I say Pandas, you say Challenge!

As the Chief Data Scientist for the school district, it is my responsibility to provide our team with the information they need in order to make decisions regarding budgets and priorities for the schools. 

Using the math and reading scores of each student along with information about the schools, in our district I will report the following:

- District Summary
- School Summary
- The Top 5 Performing Schools and their Overall Passing Percentages
- The Bottom 5 Performing Schools and their Overall Passing Percentages
- The Scores of Students by Grade for both Math and Reading
- The Scores of Students for various categories including school spending, school size, and school type



Analysis



The size of the school does appear to have an impact on the scores of students. Please refer to the Scores of Students by School Type. The smaller the school, the higher the scores. The large schools have significantly lower scores than those of the small and medium schools. 


More spending does not correlate to higher scores. In fact, the schools that spend less of their budget on each student have better scores than schools that are spending more of their budget on each student. Please refer to the Spending Summary Data Frame.
